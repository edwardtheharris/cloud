  annotations:
    description:
    - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may

      not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.

    description:
    - If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated,
      and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.

    type: bool
  host:
    description:
    - Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.

    description:
    - Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  kubeconfig:
    description:
    - Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection

  name:
    description:
    - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
      although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate

      configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
  namespace:
    description:
    - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace
      is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.
      Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this
      field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.

    description:
    - 'If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would
      take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name
      of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
      "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
      only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.'
