  annotations:
    description:
    - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may
      be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are
      not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
    type: dict
  api_key:
    description:

    description:
    - Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  context:

      and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.
    default: false
    type: bool
  host:
    description:
    - Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.
  key_file:
    description:
    - Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  kubeconfig:
    description:
    - Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection

  name:
    description:
    - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
      although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate
      name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and
      configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
  namespace:
    description:
    - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace
      is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.
      Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this
      field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.
  password:
    description:
    - Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).
  resource_definition:
    description:
    - Provide the YAML definition for the object, bypassing any modules parameters
      intended to define object attributes.

      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would
      take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name
      of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
      "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen

  state:
    description:
    - Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to
      C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if
      parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted,
      if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating
      dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list
      contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge
      is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type)
      are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).
